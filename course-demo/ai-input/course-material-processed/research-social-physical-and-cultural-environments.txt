An important focus of the SPACE team is on social and physical practices in blended environments where communication, feedback and interaction build the foundation for inclusion, accessibility and participation. Current practices that we work with include childrenâ€™s outdoor play, shopping, interpersonal care at home, shared urban spaces, programming, and the unlocking of doors. The group has extensive experience and expertise in working with novel interactive technologies, including haptic, tangible, multisensory and auditory expressions.
