Our vision is to leverage sound and music to understand and improve human communication and interaction, making them a natural part of everyday technology.

Our research concerns several fields in Sound and Music Computing (SMC), and runs in the following main streams:

Sound in interaction, including sonification and sound design
Technologies for musical expression, including design of new interfaces
The science of music performance, including emotional and gestural aspects
