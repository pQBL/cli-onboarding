Sustainable Futures Lab
Sustainable Futures Lab (SF Lab) team's research interests are located in the intersection between on the one hand media technologies and information and communication technologies (ICT) and on the other hand issues relating to sustainability and sustainable development.

Our interests span sustainability in ICT (decreasing the environmental footprint of ICT technologies in themselves), sustainability by ICT (using ICT to decrease the environmental footprint of other sectors in society), as well as overarching aspects pertaining to the role of, and the relationship between ICT and individual, collective, organizational and societal sustainability. The SF Lab team takes an interest in issues relating to and spanning aspects of environmental, social and economic sustainability, but, with a focus on environmental sustainability.
